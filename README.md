This repository is a location for larger binary files that can be referenced by pages on the devopsdays.org website but aren't served up directly.

If you would like to host your prospectus, or other large PDF files that describe your event, please place them in this repository and link to them from your page.

Please note that this repo isn't intended to hold speakers' slides. Numerous more-suitable slide hosting and file hosting options exist. Supported options are [documented in the theme reference](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#talk-page-fields).
